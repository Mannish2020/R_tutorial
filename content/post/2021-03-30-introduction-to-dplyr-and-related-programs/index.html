<p>We got started with base R. Now it’s time to introduce some packages. As explained earlier, packages add flavour to R and allow you to work much more efficiently and creatively.</p>
<p>I’ll introduce two of the most useful packages in R – <em>dplyr</em> for data management and <em>ggplot2</em> for graphics. Both of these were created by Hadley Wickham. Wickham has created or collaborated on making many other packages, and we’ll see more of those. For now, let’s just look at these two.</p>
<p>In R, if you want to access packages, you need to use the <span class="math inline">\(library()\)</span> function. Put the name of the package inside the function, like so:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)

Attaching package: &#39;dplyr&#39;
The following objects are masked from &#39;package:stats&#39;:

    filter, lag
The following objects are masked from &#39;package:base&#39;:

    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
library(ggplot2)</code></pre>
<p>Did that work? If you were told that the packages do not exist, you’ll have to install them. Installing them is easy. Use the <span class="math inline">\(install.packages()\)</span> function for that. Put the name of the package within quotes, as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;)
install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>You can also batch install packages as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(c(&quot;dplyr&quot;,&quot;ggplot2&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>Once you have installed the packages, you can load them using the <span class="math inline">\(library()\)</span> function as shown earlier. Unfortunately, you cannot batch load packages. Packages have to be loaded individually.</p>
