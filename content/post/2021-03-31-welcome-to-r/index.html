<p>If you don’t have administrator privileges, it is difficult to get RStudio. One option is to use the <strong>Anaconda</strong> framework. Anaconda is a programming environment built chiefly around the Python programming language, but it also has support for R, and includes RStudio.</p>
<p>To install Anaconda go to this page <strong><a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#windows" class="uri">https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#windows</a></strong> first, and scroll down to the very bottom of the page. You will see a section named <em>Anaconda Installers</em>.</p>
<p>That should look like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/anaconda-installers.png" /></p>
<p>Depending on your operating system and the processor configuration, download the appropriate installer.</p>
<p>Install the software in an appropriate folder. You cannot install it in the main program folders if you don’t have administrative privileges. It is advisable to create a new folder inside the <strong>My Documents</strong> folder called <strong>Programs</strong>.</p>
<p>Once you have installed it, open it. You may need to click on an <strong>.exe</strong> file for the first time. Install a shortcut, as you will need to use it repeatedly. You can try to locate it in the Search Bar if you’re using Windows.</p>
<p>Once you open it, you should see an interface like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/anaconda-top.png" style="width:150.0%;height:150.0%" />.</p>
<p>Scroll down till you see the <strong>RStudio</strong> logo.</p>
<p><img src="images/anaconda-rstudio.png" style="width:150.0%;height:150.0%" /></p>
<p>There is a clickable button beneath the logo that states <em>Install</em>. Click on that.</p>
<p>What we’re doing now is calling R from within Anaconda. R should come pre-installed with Anaconda. If not, you need to download R separately and connect the two softwares later.</p>
